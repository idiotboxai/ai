The N-Queens problem is a classic example of a backtracking algorithm. The task is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. The challenge lies in the fact that a queen can attack any piece in the same row, column, or diagonal. The goal is to find all possible solutions to this problem, or at least one solution.

Problem Explanation:
You are given a chessboard of size N x N (where N is a positive integer).

You need to place N queens on the board such that:

No two queens are in the same row.

No two queens are in the same column.

No two queens are on the same diagonal.

Backtracking Approach:
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique used to solve problems incrementally, abandoning solutions ("backtracking") as soon as we determine that they are not viable. In the case of the N-Queens problem, we attempt to place queens one row at a time and check if the current configuration is valid. If we find an invalid configuration (i.e., a queen can attack another), we backtrack and try another position.

The solution involves recursively trying to place queens in different columns of each row. For each row, we need to check if placing a queen in a particular column would cause a conflict with any previously placed queens.

Steps Involved in Solving the N-Queens Problem:
Start from Row 0: Begin placing queens starting from the first row.

Check for Safety: For each column in the current row, check if it's safe to place a queen. The position is safe if:

There is no queen in the same column.

There is no queen in the same diagonal.

Place a Queen: If the position is safe, place a queen in that column, and mark that column and both diagonals as "attacked."

Move to the Next Row: Recursively move to the next row.

Backtrack if Needed: If no safe column is found for the current row, backtrack to the previous row and try the next column.

Print Solution: Once all queens are placed on the board, print the configuration. If you want to find all solutions, continue the search after finding a valid solution.

Key Concepts:
Columns: We use an array (or list) cols of size N to mark which columns are under attack. If cols[col] = True, it means that column is under attack by a queen.

Diagonals: There are two types of diagonals:

Primary diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): The difference between the row and column indices is constant for any position on this diagonal. We use the formula row - col.

Secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): The sum of the row and column indices is constant for any position on this diagonal. We use the formula row + col.

These diagonals are tracked using two dictionaries: diag1 for the primary diagonal and diag2 for the secondary diagonal.

Backtracking: When a queen cannot be placed safely in any column of a row, the algorithm "backtracks" by removing the queen from the previous row and tries a different column.

Algorithm Breakdown:
Base Case: If a queen is placed on every row (i.e., row == N), we have found a valid solution.

Recursive Case: For each row, try placing a queen in each column and check if it’s safe. If it is, mark that column and both diagonals as attacked, then move to the next row.

Backtracking: If placing a queen in a column doesn’t lead to a solution, "unmark" the column and diagonals and try the next column.

Complexity:
Time Complexity: The worst-case time complexity is O(N!) because, in the worst case, the algorithm must try all possible placements of N queens, where N is the number of rows and columns. This results in N! permutations.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(N) due to the arrays used to track the attacked columns and diagonals, as well as the recursion stack.

Example:
For N = 4, there is a solution where the queens are placed in the following positions (rows are numbered from 0 to 3):

In this configuration:

No two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal, so it is a valid solution.

Applications:
The N-Queens problem is used to teach various concepts in computer science, including:

Backtracking algorithms.

Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP).

Recursive problem solving.

The N-Queens problem also serves as a benchmark for various optimization and algorithmic techniques, especially in artificial intelligence and constraint programming.
