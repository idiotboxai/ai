applications like game development, robotics, and route navigation systems. It combines the benefits of Dijkstra's Algorithm (which guarantees the shortest path) and Greedy Best-First Search (which prioritizes promising paths based on heuristic evaluation).

Key Concepts:
Heuristic Function (h):

A function used to estimate the remaining cost (or distance) from any node to the goal. The Manhattan Distance is commonly used for grid-based pathfinding, measuring the absolute horizontal and vertical distance between two points.

Cost Function (g):

Represents the actual cost from the start node to the current node, accumulated as the algorithm progresses.

Total Cost (f):

The sum of the actual cost (g) and the heuristic (h):
f = g + h

Nodes with lower total costs (f) are prioritized for exploration, guiding the search towards the most promising paths.

Priority Queue:

A min-heap or priority queue is used to efficiently fetch the node with the lowest total cost (f) at each step. This helps ensure that the algorithm explores the most promising nodes first.

Exploration Strategy:

The A* algorithm explores nodes in increasing order of their total cost (f). It explores the neighbors of the current node, calculates their costs, and adds them to the open list if they haven't been explored or if a cheaper path to them is found.

Path Reconstruction:

Once the goal node is reached, the algorithm can trace back from the goal to the start node using a dictionary that records the parent of each node. This enables the reconstruction of the optimal path.

Optimality:

A* guarantees an optimal path if the heuristic is admissible, meaning it never overestimates the true cost to reach the goal. If the heuristic is both admissible and consistent, A* is also efficient in terms of finding the shortest path.

Efficiency:

A* is generally more efficient than uninformed search algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s because it uses heuristics to guide the search. However, its performance heavily depends on the quality of the heuristic function used.

Variants:
Weighted A*: This is used in grids where different cells have different weights, representing varying costs for traversing different parts of the grid.

IDA (Iterative Deepening A)**: A variant that combines A* with the concept of iterative deepening, useful for environments with limited memory.
